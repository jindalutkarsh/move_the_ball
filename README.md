JAVASCRIPT PROJECT (BASIC)

Move the Ball
We will be using key events for this assignment.
Create a ball and put it at any random position on the screen. Then make it movable inside the viewport using 'W', 'A', 'S' and 'D' keys.

W - for moving in the upward direction
A - for moving in the left direction
S - for moving in the downward direction
D - for moving in the right direction

Make sure that it does not move out of the viewport at any given time. You can also restrict the movement of the ball inside a specific area.
